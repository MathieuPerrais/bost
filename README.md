# B[logp]ost

Interact with jekyll posts because I don't always remember what's the date of my blogpost and I don't remember either what's the template for an empty post.

## Usage

```
bost [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]
```

## Commands

- *create*
- *open* without really know the name of the file. ```bost open my-first``` will open ```2016-01-29-my-first-post```
- *search*
